# Hi!
---
I've been meaning to undertake this project for a while but, to be honest, I never felt too much motivation to do it.

I think the notion of a portfolio website just felt hollow and, during the semester, I get plenty of web dev practice in so I didn't really give it a second thought.

So I found myself recently working on backend development at Piction Health (an amazing company!) and it's everything I want it to be - I'm solving problems, I'm building out APIs and integrating third party services, all that fun stuff. On my way home last week, though, I realized that I missed the React work, the Tailwind work (no matter how horrible the Tailwind work is).

So, we're making the portfolio website dream a reality. Hopefully, this is going to be really awesome and pretty - if not, I'm sure my work will speak for itself:)
